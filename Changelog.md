- fixed the pinout of the jack plugs.
    - Some components may have shifted very slightly.
    - The ordering of the outputs has altered
- the labeling of the pins from the BELA_OUT* to A_FILT_OUT* is now consistent

Mistakes on PCB v0.3

* pinouts of jack plugs. Pin 1 should be GND and pin 2 signal.
* numbering of filtouts inconsistent
